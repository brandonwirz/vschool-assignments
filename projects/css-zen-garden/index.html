        <h4>The Road To Enlightenment</h4>

        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
        browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
        abandoned browsers.</p>

        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
        achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and
        the major browser creators.</p>

        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons
        of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored
        techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

        <h4>So what is this about?</h4>

        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to
        excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
        existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into
        this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is
        the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>

        <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document.
        The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
        demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of
        those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

        <section class="partGreen"> <!-- <img id="bamboo" src="images/bamboo.png"
        alt=""> --> <h4 class="participate">Participation</h4> <p class="partGreenSection">Strong visual design
        has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are
        necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS
        novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for
        advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>

        <p class="partGreenSection">You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This
        may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow
        the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>

        <p class="partGreenSection">Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have
        completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload
        your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive
        of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
        download it and place it on our server.</p>

        <h5>Benefits</h5>

        <p class="partGreenSection">Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all
        refer to showing people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal
        parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those
        who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward
        to.</p> </section>

          <h4>Requirements</h4>

          <p> Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 2 usage. CSS 3  4 should
          be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be
          provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the
          latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
          real requirement we have is that your CSS validates. </p><p> Luckily,
          designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by
          now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results
          across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web
          these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may
          not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as
          you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
          Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>

          <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws.
          Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique
          and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of
          needing another garden-related design.</p>

        <p> This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
        copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines),
        but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to
        the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
